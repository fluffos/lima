// party.c - Command to start up the party menu. Checks to see
//           if the player is currently in a party, and if not
//           prompts to see if the player wants to create a new
//           one. If the answer is no, the cmd quits without
//           creating a menu object.
// March 1, 1997: Iizuka@Lima Bean created.
// August 15, 1999: Iizuka@Lima Bean ripped out all of the modal code
//                  and moved it to TEAM_MENU.
// October, 2020: Tsath changed all references to 'team' to 'party' since
//                this is now the common lanaguage used for this functionality
//                in other online games.
