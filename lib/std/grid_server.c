** grid_server.c -- a virtual server for grid-type rooms

** Format for the object is:

**
** The data for the server is pulled from the data file provided at
** create() time.  It is an array of description-id values (in the
** first N non-comment lines).  Comments are lines beginning with #.
** After the description array are lists of rooms for the boundaries
** of the grid.  They are in north, east, south, west order; one line
** per grid spot.
